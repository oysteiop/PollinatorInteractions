# PollinatorInteractions
Using hierarchical joint models to study reproductive interactions in plant communities

https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/184192167

This repository includes the data and R code demonstrating the methods for studying pollinator-mediated reproductive interactions among coflowering plants demonstrated in Opedal & Hegland 2019 Journal of Ecology (in press).

The 'bumblebees' folder contains analyses of data on bumblebee visitation to nine coflowering species in a meadow in Norway, see Hegland et al. 2009. The relative importance of positive and negative interactions for pollinator attraction in a plant community. Ecological Research 24: 929-936.

The 'Individual_Level_Data' folder contains example analyses of simulated data of indivividual level fitness for coflowering plant individuals.
